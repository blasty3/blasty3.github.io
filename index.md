Hello, my name is Udayanto Dwi Atmojo. You can call me Udayanto.

I'm a software developer with research and development background (I hold a PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering) and entrepreneurship experience (co-founded a Finnish company gaIoTa, we do software consultancy and produce development). 

Currently residing in Helsinki, Finland. Am a graduate from The University of Auckland, New Zealand. 

The core work of my PhD was a middleware and library based on Java for programming distributed embedded systems, demonstrated in Industry 4.0 application, based on distributed embedded computers Beaglebone Black.  

Working with data has been both a hobby and passion, in addition with working with embedded computers (Raspberry Pis, Beaglebone, etc), microcontrollers, and electronics.
