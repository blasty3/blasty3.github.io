Hello, my name is Udayanto Dwi Atmojo. You can call me Udayanto.

I'm a software developer with research and development background (I hold a PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering) and entrepreneurship experience (co-founded a Finnish company gaIoTa, we do software consultancy and produce development). 

Currently residing in Helsinki, Finland. Am a graduate from The University of Auckland, New Zealand. 
 
As someone with research background, working with data has been a natural habit for me.

You can contact me at udayanto.atmojo (at) gmail (dot) com.
