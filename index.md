Hello, my name is Udayanto Dwi Atmojo. You can call me Udayanto.

I'm a software developer with research and development (R&D) background (I hold a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering) and entrepreneurship experience (co-founded a Finnish company gaIoTa Oy, we do software consultancy and produce development). 

Currently residing in Helsinki, Finland. Am a graduate from The University of Auckland, New Zealand. 

The core work of my PhD has been a middleware / library based on Java for distributed embedded systems, demonstrated in Industry 4.0 demonstration.  

Working with data has been both a hobby and passion, in addition with working with embedded computers (Raspberry PIs, for example), microcontrollers, and electronics.

You can contact me at udayanto.atmojo (at) gmail (dot) com.
